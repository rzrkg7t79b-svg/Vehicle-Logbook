I want you to redesign the UI of my existing app to a modern, premium, iOS-26-inspired “glass / frosted / liquid glass” style.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT change any business logic, backend logic, API calls, database structure, state management, or app behavior.
- Do NOT change any functionality.
- Do NOT remove or rename any functions, endpoints, or data models.
- The app must behave 100% identical after the refactor.
- Only the visual appearance (UI, layout, styling) should change.

DESIGN GOALS:
- Modern iOS 26 style UI with:
  - Glassmorphism / frosted glass panels
  - Subtle blur backgrounds
  - Soft transparency
  - Smooth shadows and depth
  - Rounded corners
  - Clean, premium, minimalistic look
  - Light reflections and layered surfaces

COLOR RULES:
- The main color scheme must be: Black, Orange, White.
- These three colors define the global look and feel.
- Keep all existing function-specific / semantic colors exactly as they are.
- Do NOT change the meaning of any colors (e.g. success, warning, error, feature-specific colors).
- You may only modernize how colors are presented (e.g. gradients, glass overlays, subtle lighting).

LAYOUT RULES:
- Keep the same screens, same components, same structure.
- You may improve spacing, padding, alignment, and visual hierarchy.
- You may modernize components (cards, lists, buttons, modals, inputs, navigation, etc).
- Do NOT remove, merge, or add features or screens.

TECHNICAL RULES:
- Do NOT introduce new frameworks.
- Do NOT migrate the project.
- Only refactor UI components and styling.
- Prefer creating reusable modern UI wrappers if helpful.

VERSION RULE:
- Update the app version shown in the footer to: v2.0.9
- Do not change anything else related to versioning, releases, or backend metadata.

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
- Step by step:
  1. Identify shared UI components
  2. Create a modern glass-style design system
  3. Apply it consistently across the app
  4. Keep everything else untouched

FINAL GOAL:
The app should look like a modern iOS 26 glass-style app using a Black / Orange / White theme, but function exactly like before.

Before finalizing, double-check:
- No logic changes
- No backend changes
- No data model changes
- No feature changes
- Only UI/styling changes

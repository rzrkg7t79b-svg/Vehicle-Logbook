Implement the following improvements in the existing app while keeping all current features, logic, and behavior unchanged unless explicitly described below. Do not refactor or modify unrelated parts of the application. The goal is to add these improvements with minimal risk and ideally without any database schema changes. If you believe a database change is unavoidable, explain exactly why and propose the smallest possible alternative first.

First improvement: TimeDriverSIXT max-time capping and “if needed” overflow hint. Currently, TimeDriverSIXT only caps the calculated result to the configured maximum working time per day, meaning if the calculation exceeds 100%, the UI still shows 100%. Extend this behavior by adding an additional informational hint that appears only when the calculation exceeds the configured max working time per day. When the calculation is over the limit, keep showing 100% as before, but also display a text hint in the format “if needed + X h Y min” representing the extra time beyond the configured max working time that would be required. This “extra time” must be computed as (calculated required time − max working time per day − 30 minutes). The 30-minute value is a “grace time” used only internally in the overflow calculation and must not be shown as a separate value anywhere. This grace time is applied only in the over-limit case; when the calculated required time is below or equal to the max working time per day, no grace time is subtracted and no overflow hint is shown. Ensure the calculation rounds and formats hours/minutes cleanly (no negative values, no confusing decimals). Apply the same logic consistently anywhere TimeDriverSIXT is shown, including exports, if TimeDriverSIXT values are exported. Implement this as pure logic/UI behavior without altering the database schema.

Second improvement: MasterSIXT dashboard “Break?SIXT” top task under Daily Countdown. On the MasterSIXT dashboard start page, add a new top-level task entry named “Break?SIXT” displayed directly under the existing Daily Countdown section. This item must use the same visual style as Daily Countdown entries. It must show a countdown to 13:00 (1:00 PM) each day. If the current time is before 13:00 and the task is not done, show the countdown remaining. If it is past 13:00 and the task is not done, display it as red and “Overdue”. The “Break?SIXT” task must be markable as “Done” directly from the dashboard without opening any modal or sub-window (single-click / single-tap action). Once marked “Done”, it must remain shown as Done for that day and must be reflected identically in the export as either “Done” or “Overdue” depending on its state. Ensure the export representation matches the dashboard state. Implement this without changing the database schema; reuse existing task/state storage patterns already present in the app. If no suitable existing storage exists, use the smallest possible approach that avoids schema changes (for example by storing state in an existing generic task table or existing metadata mechanism), and only propose a schema change as a last resort.

After implementing these improvements, verify that no existing functionality is broken, especially all current reset logic, exports, and dashboard interactions. Provide a short summary of what was changed and where.

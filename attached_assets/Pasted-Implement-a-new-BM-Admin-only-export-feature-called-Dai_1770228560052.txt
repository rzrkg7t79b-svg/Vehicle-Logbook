Implement a new BM/Admin-only export feature called “Daily Briefing” in the existing app, using the exact same export technique and code pattern as the current “Export for Teams” functionality. Do not change any existing behavior or non-related features. Reuse and copy the existing export implementation so the rendering, layout stability, and saving/export process work reliably the same way.

Access control: the Daily Briefing export must be visible and usable only for BM/Admin users (same permission logic as the existing BM/Admin-only controls). Add a new button labeled “DailyBriefing Export” directly underneath the existing “Export for Teams” button, matching the same UI style, spacing, and interaction behavior.

Export output: the Daily Briefing must be exported and saved as a single Full HD image in landscape format, exactly 1920×1080. Ensure the export result is crisp and readable at that resolution.

Header: at the top of the exported image, display the title exactly as “DailyBriefing41137 + current weekday + date”. The “41137” part must be bold. The weekday and date must reflect the current date at the time of export.

Content order and scope: at the very top of the briefing content (under the header), show the values from the existing FutureSIXT module, but label and present them as “TodaySIXT” within the Daily Briefing (this is only a naming/presentation change for the briefing). Extend the FutureSIXT module by adding two new metrics: under “Car” add a “DayMin” field, and under “Van” add a “DayMin” field. The DayMin value must be color-coded: if it is below 0 it must display in red; if it is 0 or above it should display in green or white (matching the app’s current visual language, but clearly not red). These new DayMin metrics must appear in the Daily Briefing export as well.

The Daily Briefing export must also include, in a layout optimized for quick scanning at a glance, the following sections: TimeDriverSIXT, UpgradeSIXT (placed prominently, with license plate and reason clearly visible), and the KPI tiles with the same traffic-light (ampel) logic used on the MasterSIXT dashboard start page. All key numbers must be shown at an appropriate size for readability in a 1920×1080 image.

UpgradeSIXT enhancement: add a new KPI tile to UpgradeSIXT that can be edited by BM/Admin users. This KPI represents “UP % MTD” and must use the same UI style as the KPI tiles on the start page. Both ACT and Goal must be editable by BM/Admin. The default Goal value must be 15%. Apply the traffic-light thresholds as follows: green when ACT is greater than or equal to Goal; yellow when ACT is up to 1.5 percentage points below Goal (i.e., ACT ≥ Goal − 1.5%); red when ACT is below that (ACT < Goal − 1.5%). This UP % MTD KPI tile must appear in three places: on the main start page KPI area (if applicable to your existing design), in the Export for Teams output, and within the UpgradeSIXT section of the Daily Briefing export.

BM/Admin message input: before triggering the Daily Briefing export, allow the BM/Admin user to enter a short message in a textbox. This message must then be displayed prominently in the Daily Briefing presentation and included in the exported image. The textbox must be shown only for BM/Admin and should be placed in a logical position near the DailyBriefing Export button. Ensure line breaks or wrapping are handled cleanly so the message remains readable in the export.

Overall goal: the Daily Briefing export is intended to provide a fast, single-screen overview. Prioritize a clean, structured layout, consistent spacing, and strong readability. Use the same proven export rendering method as Export for Teams to avoid formatting issues, and ensure all included data matches what is shown in the app at the moment of export.

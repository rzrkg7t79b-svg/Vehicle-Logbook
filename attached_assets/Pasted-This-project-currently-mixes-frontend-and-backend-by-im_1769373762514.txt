This project currently mixes frontend and backend by importing database and backend files (shared/schema.ts and shared/routes.ts) directly into the client. This works in Replit but breaks production builds on platforms like Vercel because the frontend bundle must not contain any backend or database code. I want you to refactor the architecture without changing any application behavior, UI, features, or business logic. Do not remove any features, do not change any workflows, do not change any UI or UX, and do not simplify or rewrite any functionality. This is a pure structural and build-compatibility refactor only.

The goal is to strictly separate frontend and backend concerns. The frontend (client folder) must no longer import anything from the shared or server folders and must not import any database, drizzle, or node-only modules. The backend must keep using shared/schema.ts and shared/routes.ts exactly as they are and must continue to work exactly as before.

Create frontend-safe type files in client/src/api-types.ts and client/src/shared-types.ts and move or copy only the necessary TypeScript types and interfaces there, without any database, drizzle, or zod code. Replace all client imports from @shared/schema or @shared/routes with imports from these frontend-safe type files. For shared constants such as flowTaskTypes, copy them into a new folder like client/src/constants and update all client imports to use these frontend constants instead of backend files.

The frontend must only communicate with the backend via HTTP API calls (for example /api/…) and must only use its own local types and constants. The backend must remain unchanged in its logic, structure, and behavior.

After this refactor, the command “cd client && npm run build” must succeed, and the project must be deployable to Vercel. The application’s behavior, UI, and features must remain 100% identical. This is only an architectural separation to make the project compatible with production frontend builds. Proceed carefully and update all affected client files.

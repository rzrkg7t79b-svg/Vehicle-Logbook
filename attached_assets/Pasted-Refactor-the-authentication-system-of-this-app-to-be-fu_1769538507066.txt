Refactor the authentication system of this app to be fully frontend-only and remove any dependency on the backend or database for login, without changing any other functionality of the application.

Currently the app uses a PIN-based login with users stored in the database, and also has a special emergency master code that already works fully client-side. I want the normal users to work exactly the same way as this emergency code does, but with multiple users.

Implement the following changes:

Move the entire user list (initials, pin, roles, isAdmin, etc.) into a frontend-only data store (for example a JSON, TS file, or localStorage-backed store).

The login screen must validate the PIN purely on the client, without any API call.

The emergency master code must keep working exactly as before.

After successful login, the app must behave exactly the same as now (same roles, same permissions, same UI, same flows).

The backend must no longer be involved in authentication at all.

The /api/users login check must no longer be used for authentication.

All other API features (todos, vehicles, etc.) must remain untouched.

User management requirements:

The list of users must remain editable from the UI (add/edit/remove users).

Changes to users should be persisted in localStorage (or similar client storage).

On first load, initialize the user list with the existing default users.

Important constraints:

Do NOT change any UI except what is strictly necessary for login to work.

Do NOT change any business logic, features, routes, or screens.

Do NOT change backend APIs except removing their involvement in login.

This is a refactor only of the authentication mechanism.

After this change:

The app must work fully without backend for login.

Login must work even if /api is offline.

The app must still use the backend for all non-auth data (todos, vehicles, etc).

🧠 Warum das deine Probleme löst

Vercel Serverless + Sessions + Cookies + DB = kompliziert & fehleranfällig

Frontend-only PIN = 100% stabil, sofort

Deine App ist intern kein echtes Security-System, sondern ein Terminal-Tool → völlig ok so

Genau so funktioniert dein Emergency Code ja bereits
